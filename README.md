Repository for Master's Thesis NS-3 DATP Files

Contains:

+ Feeder simulation script (script/feeder.cc)
+ Topology files used (topology/*)
+ Simulation outputs used for results (outputs.tgz)
+ AODV code changes used on NS-3.16 (Aodv.diff)
+ NS-3 DATP module (all other files)

To install the DATP module, follow the instructions for creating a new module in NS-3.

It should be as simple as moving this directory into your NS-3 src folder, and doing a build (./waf)

Outputs.tgz contains Python scripts that were used to mass execute the simulation trials given in the thesis.

Enjoy.
